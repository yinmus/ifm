ifm - is a lightweight file manager that focuses on speed of use.
=================================================================
It has many hotkeys that can be customized (src/config.h). There are icons that can be disabled:
[optimal]:
*change the value of the sd variable in src/ifm.c
[or a less optimal option:]
*open the command mode every time after startup and type ‘set sd 1’
===================================================================
It also has a built-in archiver, which makes it easier to work with archives. You can view the list of files and unzip them.
