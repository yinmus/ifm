console mode is needed for operations with external programs.
After entering the mode using k_console (default: ‘o’), you can write almost anything, for example:

1. Create an archive of the current file:
tar -cf name.tar $ -> will be executed as: tar -cf name.tar fullpath/to/file

You can also create an archive from several files:

tar -cf name.tar file1 file2 -> tar -cf name.tar fullpath/to/file1 fullpath/to/file2

Mode logic: by default, after logging in, you write the name of the program, and this program opens the currently selected file, i.e.:
{programm} {current_file}
The file name is not required; if there is no specifier as described below, it will be automatically inserted at the end of the command,  and if you added the file name in this way:
{programm} filename
then the program will execute as follows:
{programm} {filename} {current_filename}
Therefore, it is not recommended to do this unless there are specific situations, such as creating an archive with the current file and some other file.
If you write the modifier %n (the location of which is not important): 
{programm} 
in the above case, {programm} will simply be executed.
If you write $ in the input, which means the name of the current file, then the program will not automatically put the current file at the end of the command, it will be something like this:
{programm} {path/to/current_file_name}
This may be necessary in cases such as the following:
mv $ path/to/dir -> mv path/to/current_file_name path/to/dir
