console mode is necessary for working with external programs.
After entering the mode, use k_console (default: “o”).

There are aliases in the command that can make it easier to type a command, you can also create aliases without heavily editing the code.

%a is the absolute path to the selected file.
%r is the relative path to the selected file.
%d is the absolute path to the current directory.


In general, everything here is limited only by your imagination, but here is an example:

Create an archive of the current file:
tar -cf %r.tar %r -> will be executed as: tar -cf filename.tar filename

What is the mode for?:
for example, you want to open the default file using Enter/l or the mouse, but the file opens with the wrong program. You write specifically:
{program} {file name}
In addition to this, you can also perform tasks that are beyond the power of the file manager.:
create archives and more
