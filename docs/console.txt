console mode is necessary for working with external programs.
After entering the mode using k_console (default: “o”).

There are aliases in the command that can simplify writing the command:
%a - Absolute path to the selected file
%r - Relative path to the selected file
%d - Absolute path to the current directory

In general, everything here is limited only by your imagination, but here is an example:

Create an archive of the current file:
tar -cf %r.tar %r -> will be executed as: tar -cf filename.tar filename

Meaning of the mode:
The original idea: for example, you want to open a file by default using Enter / l or the mouse, but the file opens with the wrong program. You write specifically:
{programm} {filename}
In addition to this, you can also perform tasks that the file manager cannot do:
create archives and more
