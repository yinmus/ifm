ifm — File Manager

ifm is a file manager designed for quickly moving between files and managing them. The program comes with an archive handler that allows you to work with a large number of popular archive types quickly, although not always perfectly.

Despite its small size, the program has very good functionality, such as a large number of hotkeys:
(only the default keys will be mentioned below — you can customize them)

Movement / Navigation:

Of course, you can move up and down through files.
(For the next 4, you can use the corresponding arrows):

k -> to the file above

j -> to the file below

(A slash will indicate an alternative key for this action)

l / Enter -> if it is a file, open it; if it is a directory, go to it

h -> go to the directory above

pgdn / ^d -> page down

pgup / ^u -> page up

(A plus sign will indicate key combinations)

G -> go to the last file

g + g -> go to the first file

{n} + j -> move down {n} files

{n} + k -> move up {n} files

(If you have used vim, you will have no trouble understanding how hotkeys and commands work.)

- -> go to the previous directory (aka cd -)

Goto mode:

There is a goto mode that helps you quickly navigate through root directories.
g -> Enter goto mode.
Next, you will see a prompt window.

File operations:

o -> Open the console described in console.txt
r -> Rename the current file
x -> Delete the current file
m -> Create a directory
t -> Create a file

Copy / Paste / Cut:

c+x -> Cut the current file
y+y -> Copy the current file
p -> Paste files from the buffer 
r+b -> Clear the buffer (delete all copied and cut files)

Marking:

(This mode is similar to selecting files in graphical file managers)

(Marked with a red * before the file name) 

v -> Mark the current file
M -> List of marked files
e -> Enter marking mode
(As with goto, a hint window appears)

Other:

q -> Exit ifm
^h/. -> Show/Hide files beginning with .
/ -> Search
n -> After you have used the search, you can use n to move through the found files
N -> Move backwards through the found files
:/; -> Command mode (not described in detail, but described in commands.txt)
f5 -> Refresh screen
, -> Show absolute path
