____

### *ifm* - is a lightweight file manager that focuses on speed of use.

**It has many hotkeys that can be customized (src/config.h). There are icons that can be disabled:**
#### [optimal]:
**change the value of the sd variable in *src/ifm.c***
#### [or a less optimal option:]
**open the command mode every time after startup and type ‘set sd 1’**

#### It also has a built-in archiver, which makes it easier to work with archives. You can view the list of files and unzip them.

**About hotkeys:

**About console mode:
